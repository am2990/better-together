Better Together is a platform for flexibly connecting multiple smartphones together to separate common tasks. Better Together helps you connect phones together to share, help and work with other people.

Plugins for Better Together let you split other services or apps into separate parts on different phones.

See the [toolkit website](https://www.bettertogethertoolkit.org/) and [research project website](http://www.reshapingthefuture.org/) for more details and related work.

## Developing your own plugin
To develop plugins, all that is needed is to import the Better Together API. See the [api source and documentation](https://github.com/reshaping-the-future/better-together-api), and the [sample plugin](https://github.com/reshaping-the-future/better-together-chat-sample).

## Integrating Better Together into your own app
Developing a plugin is the simplest way to create services using the Better Together framework. However, if you'd prefer deeper integration, it is possible to add its connectivity to your own app. See, for example, [swarachakra keyboard](https://github.com/IDC-IITBombay/swarachakra-android/tree/bt_remote_keyboard), which enables remote text input in Indic scripts.
